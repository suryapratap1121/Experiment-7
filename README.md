# Experiment-7

Aim: Study and Implement C++ Arrays and Strings
THEORY:

Arrays hold multiple elements of the same type in contiguous memory.

Loops are used to access and print array elements.

Printing verifies correct data storage and manipulation.

These basics support more complex C++ data handling.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program.

Declare an integer array of size 5.

Prompt and input 5 integers into the array.

Print all array elements using a loop.

End the program.

Aim: Find a Number in an Array
THEORY:

Uses linear search to find a number in an array.

Checks each element until the number is found or ends.

Useful for validation and basic search understanding.

ALGORITHM:

Start program; declare array and search variables.

Input 5 integers.

Input number to search.

Loop through array; if found, set flag and break.

Print if number is present or not.

End program.

Aim: Sum and Average of Array Elements
THEORY:

Calculates sum and average of array values.

Demonstrates traversal and arithmetic operations.

ALGORITHM:

Start program; declare array, sum, and average.

Input 5 integers and sum them.

Calculate average = sum / 5.

Print sum and average.

End program.

Aim: Find Minimum and Maximum Number
THEORY:

Finds largest and smallest elements in an array.

Tracks min and max while iterating.

ALGORITHM:

Start program; input number of elements.

Declare array and input elements.

Initialize min and max to first element.

Loop through array to update min and max.

Print min and max.

End program.

Aim: Different Ways to Declare Strings
THEORY:

Shows four methods: C-style arrays and std::string.

Highlights differences between char arrays and string objects.

ALGORITHM:

Declare strings in different ways.

Print all strings.

End program.

Aim: String Concatenation
THEORY:

Combines two strings using + or append() for std::string.

C-style uses strcat() or loops.

ALGORITHM:

Input two strings.

Concatenate and print result.

End program.

Aim: Print String in Reverse
THEORY:

Prints characters from end to start.

Helps understand indexing.

ALGORITHM:

Input string.

Loop backwards to print each character.

End program.

Aim: Palindrome Checking
THEORY:

Checks if string reads the same forwards and backwards.

Compares characters from both ends.

ALGORITHM:

Input string and get length.

Compare characters from start and end.

Print if palindrome or not.

End program.

Conclusion

This experiment covered basic array and string operations in C++, helping to understand data manipulation, searching, arithmetic, and string processing techniques necessary for programming proficiency.
